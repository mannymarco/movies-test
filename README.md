## Technology choices and justifications

### Express

Express, on top of being the most popular and best documented framework, aims to augment what is available with standalone node. The requirements of this task suit express well. If I desired greater control over how the key features of node were implemented I would perhaps have chosen Koa. Koa is syntactially similar and is compatible with many modules designed for use with express. Koa is barebones, and would thus offer more flexibility in modifying how the router might work, for example.

### MongoDB

I have chosen MongoDB for a few reasons, chiefly because it is built for agile development. If this technical test were actually, say, one of my projects in the half day scheme, It would be feasible that the project could grow from something I spent four hours on each week to a large-scale project with an entire team assigned to it.  Using MongoDB from the outset would allow the project to “evolve without requiring expensive migrations” (MongoDB, 2019).
